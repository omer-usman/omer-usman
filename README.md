## About Me
As a passionate IT professional with a focus on mobile development, I am committed to continuous personal growth and seizing opportunities beyond the classroom[^1^][1]. With a strong foundation in academic excellence, backed by a full-fee scholarship, I deeply value education and the privileges it has afforded me[^2^][2].

My ambition drives me to actively participate in extracurricular activities, shaping my existence through my choices[^3^][3]. I hold firm opinions on life, advocating for hard work, curiosity, saving, and planning. While I may not claim extensive worldly knowledge, I cherish the time I have and aim to inspire others with my personality.

Choosing computer science as my field of study has been transformative, allowing me to delve into the realms of science, electronics, and mathematics. The pandemic further highlighted the significance of IT, fueling my interest in hands-on learning, programming, system management, and code testing and debugging.

My journey has led me to specialize in machine learning and AI, areas where I can leverage my skills in communication, teamwork, flexibility, confidence, problem-solving, self-management, and leadership. I am proficient in graphics design, UI/UX design, Unity, Blender 3D, Adobe PS, Canva/Adobe CCExpress, Git, game design, web design (UI/UX), Figma, and application development.
